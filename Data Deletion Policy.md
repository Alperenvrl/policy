DATA DELETION POLICY

Introduction
This policy explains how HabitPulse (“we”, “our,” “us”) handles requests from users who want their personal data permanently deleted. It outlines your rights, the steps involved, what data is affected, and what remains after deletion.

What Data We Collect
We collect and process the following types of data:
- Your account information: email, username, profile image, and biography
- Usage data: habit completion records, frequency of use, timestamps
- Health and activity data: step count, calories, distance, workout logs
- User-generated content: custom habits, goals, personal notes
- Device and technical data: device type, system logs, crash reports, login history

Your Rights
You have the right to:
- Request complete deletion of your personal data
- Learn what data we hold about you
- Withdraw any previously given consent for data processing

How to Request Deletion
There are two ways to request data deletion:

1. Using the App
- Open the app and go to Settings → Privacy → Delete My Data
- Follow the on-screen instructions
- Your account and data will be permanently deleted

2. By Email
- Send an email to habitpulseapp@gmail.com with the subject: “Data Deletion Request”
- Include your registered email address or username
- We’ll send you a confirmation code to verify your identity
- Once verified, we’ll delete your data within 14 days

Deletion Process
Once your request is confirmed:
- We verify your identity
- Your data is flagged for deletion
- It’s removed from our active systems within 14 days
- Backups are automatically cleared within 60 days
- We will notify you once everything is permanently deleted

What May Be Retained
Even after deletion, certain information may still be retained:
- Data required for legal, tax, or financial compliance
- Anonymous or aggregated data used for statistical purposes
- Transaction records related to subscriptions or purchases

What Deletion Means
Deleting your HabitPulse account will:
- Permanently remove your account and all associated data
- Cancel access to any premium services
- Erase your habit history and personal records
- Remove all user data from our systems, including Firebase

Third-Party Services
HabitPulse works with services like Firebase, Google Fit, and Google Authentication.
- We will forward deletion requests to these integrated services where possible
- If you linked accounts (e.g., Google Fit), you may need to delete data manually on their platforms

Data Security and Deletion Standards
We use secure deletion methods to ensure that once your data is removed, it cannot be recovered.
- This includes deletion from live databases and permanent removal from backup storage
- Our policy follows international best practices on data retention and destruction

Policy Updates
This policy may be revised to reflect changes in the law or improvements in our processes. If we make important changes, we will notify you through the app or by email.
