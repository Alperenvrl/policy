# DATA DELETION POLICY

## INTRODUCTION

This Data Deletion Policy outlines how HabitPulse ("we," "our," "us") handles user data deletion requests and describes the process users can follow to request the deletion of their personal data from our mobile application.

## WHAT DATA WE COLLECT

HabitPulse collects the following types of data:
- Account information (email, username, profile information)
- Usage statistics (such as app usage frequency, habit completion data)
- Health and activity data (including step count, activity metrics)

- Request the complete deletion of your personal data
- Request information about what data we store about you
- Revoke previously given consents for data collection and processing

## HOW TO REQUEST DATA DELETION

You can request deletion of your personal data through the following methods:

1. **In-App Deletion**:
   - Navigate to Settings > Privacy > Delete My Data
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to confirm data deletion
   - Your account and data will be permanently deleted

2. **Email Request**:
   - Send an email to habitpulseapp@gmail.com with the subject "Data Deletion Request"
   - Include your account email address or username in the email
   - We will verify your identity by sending a confirmation code to your registered email address
   - Once verified, we will process your deletion request within 14 days

## DELETION PROCESS

Upon receiving your data deletion request:
1. We will verify your identity as the account owner to ensure data security
2. Your account and all personal data will be marked for deletion
3. We will remove your personal data from our active systems within 14 days
4. Backups containing your information will be purged within our backup cycle (maximum 60 days)
5. You will receive confirmation when your data has been deleted

## DATA RETENTION

Some information may be retained even after account deletion for the following reasons:
- Information required for legal compliance or regulatory purposes
- Anonymized statistical data that cannot be linked to you personally
- Transaction records required by financial regulations (for premium subscriptions)

## EFFECT OF ACCOUNT DELETION

Please be aware that deleting your account:
- Permanently removes all your personal information and cannot be undone
- Removes access to any premium features or paid subscriptions
- Deletes your habit history, activity tracking data, and other user-generated content
- Removes your data from our Firebase database

## THIRD-PARTY DATA

HabitPulse integrates with certain third-party services (Google Authentication, AdMob, Firebase). When you delete your HabitPulse account:
- We will request deletion of your data from these integrated services
- For services you connected directly (like Google Fit), you may need to manage data permissions directly through those services

## UPDATES TO THIS POLICY

We may update this Data Deletion Policy periodically. Significant changes will be communicated through in-app notifications or email.
