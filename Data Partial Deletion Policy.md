# DATA PARTIAL DELETION POLICY

## INTRODUCTION

This Data Partial Deletion Policy outlines how HabitPulse ("we," "our," "us") handles requests for selective deletion of user data while maintaining the user account. This policy complements our Data Deletion Policy, which covers complete account deletion.

## PARTIAL DATA DELETION OPTIONS

2. **Habit Records**
   - Historical habit completion data
   - Habit streak information
   - Custom habit details
   - Progress metrics

3. **Personal Profile Information**

## HOW TO REQUEST PARTIAL DATA DELETION

Users can request partial deletion of their data through the following methods:

1. **In-App Data Management**
   - Navigate to Settings > Privacy > Manage My Data
   - Select the specific data categories to delete
   - Confirm your choices when prompted
   - Data will be removed within 7 days

2. **Email Request**
   - Send an email to habitpulseapp@gmail.com with subject "Partial Data Deletion Request"
   - Clearly specify which data categories you want deleted
   - Include your account email for verification
   - We will respond within 5 business days with verification instructions
   - Upon verification, selected data will be deleted within 14 days

## PARTIAL DELETION PROCESS

When you submit a partial data deletion request:

1. We will verify your identity as the account owner
2. The specified data categories will be marked for deletion
3. Data will be removed from our active systems within 14 days
4. Backups containing the deleted data will be automatically purged during our backup cycle (maximum 60 days)
5. You will receive confirmation when the selected data has been deleted

## EFFECTS AND LIMITATIONS OF PARTIAL DELETION

Users should be aware of the following implications when requesting partial data deletion:

1. **Irreversibility**
   - Partially deleted data cannot be recovered once removed
   - Consider exporting data before requesting deletion if you might need it later

2. **Functionality Impact**
   - Deleting activity history may affect your statistics, trends, and achievements
   - Removing habit records will reset streaks and progress metrics
   - Some app features may have limited functionality after certain data is deleted

3. **Data Regeneration**
   - If you continue using the app after partial deletion, new data in the same categories will be generated
   - You may need to request deletion again for newly created data

4. **Third-Party Services**
   - If you've connected third-party services (e.g., Google Fit), you may need to delete data separately from those platforms
   - We will attempt to propagate deletion requests to integrated third-party services where possible

## DATA RETENTION AFTER PARTIAL DELETION

Even after partial data deletion:

1. We will retain minimum information necessary to maintain your account
2. Anonymous or aggregated statistical information that cannot identify you personally may be maintained
3. Data required for legal compliance or legitimate business interests may be retained in accordance with applicable laws

## AUTOMATED PARTIAL DELETION OPTIONS

HabitPulse also offers automated data retention controls:

1. **Time-Based Auto-Deletion**
   - Navigate to Settings > Privacy > Data Retention
   - Set time periods after which certain data categories are automatically deleted
   - Options include: 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year

2. **Data Minimization Tools**
   - Anonymize historical data beyond a certain timeframe
   - Reduce precision of sensitive metrics (e.g., exact location to general area)
   - Limit data collection for specific features

## EXEMPT DATA

Some data may be exempt from partial deletion requests due to:

1. Legal requirements and regulatory compliance obligations
2. Fraud prevention and security purposes
3. Dispute resolution and enforcement of our terms and policies
4. Technical limitations in separating certain data points

## UPDATES TO THIS POLICY

We may update this Data Partial Deletion Policy periodically. Significant changes will be communicated through in-app notifications or email.
