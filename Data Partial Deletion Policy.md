DATA PARTIAL DELETION POLICY

1. PURPOSE  
This policy outlines how HabitPulse handles user requests to delete specific categories of personal data while maintaining an active account. It complements our full Data Deletion Policy, which covers complete account removal.

3. ELIGIBLE DATA CATEGORIES  
The following types of data can be partially deleted upon user request:

- Data shared with third-party services (e.g., Google Fit) must be deleted separately  

8. AUTOMATED DELETION OPTIONS  
Users can enable time-based data auto-deletion in Settings > Privacy > Data Retention:

- Available options: 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year  
- Users can also anonymize or reduce the precision of sensitive data  

9. DATA RETENTION AFTER DELETION  
We will retain only the minimum necessary data to maintain your account, fulfill legal obligations, and ensure service integrity. Anonymized or aggregated data may be retained for analytical purposes.

10. EXCEPTIONS  
Partial deletion requests may not apply to:

- Data required by law or financial regulations
