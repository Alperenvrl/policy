DATA PARTIAL DELETION POLICY

1. PURPOSE
This Data Partial Deletion Policy sets forth how HabitPulse (“we/our/us”) processes requests for selective deletion of user data, while keeping user accounts active. It complements our full Data Deletion Policy.

2. SCOPE
Applies to user-initiated deletion of specific data types within an active account. It outlines eligible/ineligible data, request channels, processing timeline, retention limits, and impacts.

3. PRINCIPLES & LEGAL COMPLIANCE
We use transparent procedures to comply with regulations (e.g. GDPR, CCPA) while following data minimization and purpose limitation principles. Secure deletion methods are applied to ensure irrecoverability :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

4. ELIGIBLE DATA CATEGORIES
Users may request deletion of:
• Activity Data: step counts, exercise logs, timestamps, health metrics  
• Habit Tracking Data: historical completion, streaks, custom habits, progress indicators  
• Profile Data: profile image, username, bio/about, personal goals  
• Device Info: associated device records, login history, location access logs

5. INELIGIBLE DATA CATEGORIES
The following are not eligible for partial deletion while maintaining an account:
• Core Account Data: account email, account creation date, identity verification
• Billing Data: subscription status, payment/transaction records (regulatory requirement)
• System & Security Data: security logs, crash reports, fraud detection records

6. HOW TO REQUEST PARTIAL DELETION
Option A – In-App:
• Go to Settings → Privacy → Manage My Data  
• Select categories to delete and confirm  
• Data removal initiated within 7 calendar days

Option B – Email:
• Email habitpulseapp@gmail.com with subject “Partial Data Deletion Request”  
• Clearly specify data categories and include account email for verification  
• We respond within 5 business days; after verification, deletion occurs within 14 days

7. DELETION PROCESS & TIMELINE
• Identity verification conducted upon submission  
• Selected data removed from active systems within 14 days  
• Backups purged within standard cycle (maximum retention: 60 days)  
• Confirmation sent to user upon completion

8. EFFECTS & LIMITATIONS
• Deleted data cannot be recovered—export before deletion if needed  
• Feature limitations may occur (e.g. loss of streaks, progress tracking)  
• New data generated post-deletion may require future removal requests  
• Deletion may not automatically propagate to third-party integrations (e.g. Google Fit); separate actions may be needed

9. AUTOMATED CONTROLS & DATA MINIMIZATION
• Time-based auto-deletion: users can configure auto-deletion periods (30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year)  
• Data minimization options: anonymization, reduced metric precision, restricted collection for specific use cases

10. EXCEPTIONS & LEGAL RETENTION
Certain data may be exempt from deletion due to:
• Compliance with legal/regulatory obligations (e.g. tax, audit, fraud prevention)  
• Technical limitations separating interdependent or system-critical data  
• Active enforcement or ongoing investigations

11. POLICY REVIEW, AUDIT & GOVERNANCE
• Policy reviewed and updated regularly in accordance with evolving regulations and best practices :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
• Roles and responsibilities defined across legal, IT, compliance and operations teams :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
